# pig-game

This is called the Pig Game, the way it works is you start the app up, you can set the final score that must be reached in order to win by typing in a number at the bottom. By default the winning score is 100. To get points you roll dice and can keep rolling until you get a one. At any point you can decide to hold ending your turn and giving you the points you have accumulated for the round. It is then the next players turn. First to 100 (or the score set by you) is the winner.
